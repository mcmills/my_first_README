# My first README
## In this little proyect I am going to experiment how to creater a good README
This is my first paragraph and I am going to do it as long as I can, because I want to see how it locks like.

**_I am going to try_** some types of **letters**, because I want to try some **Blod** and some *Italic* style.

>Do not give up.<br/>

I am going to write some code here:<br/>
```
var number_1 = 5;
var number_2 = 10;
if(number_1 > number_2){
    console.log(number_1 + ' is greater than ' + number_2);
}
else{
    console.log(number_2 + ' is greater than ' + number_1);
}
```
